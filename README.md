Simple Discord chatbot that runs locally using Huggingface transformers and langchain. The chatbot is able to respond to messages a user sends with the -chat command (configurable in the code) and keep limited memory of the conversation. The conversations are not filtered at the moment.

As this bot runs an LLM locally, a GPU is required to properly run it.
